# Payroll Payslip Management Page Plan

## New Directory Structure
- Create a new directory at `app/payslip` to house all files related to the payslip feature.

## Summary Section
- Create components within `app/payslip` to display key payroll metrics (e.g., total payroll expenses, number of payslips generated) over selected periods.
- These components will fetch data from the backend.

## Individual Payslip Management
- Implement search functionality for employees within `app/payslip`.
- Create pages/components within `app/payslip` for a detailed view of each payslip.
- Implement actions such as viewing, printing, and emailing PDF copies. This will likely involve new API endpoints and integration with a PDF generation library.

## Batch Processing Capabilities
- Implement functionality within `app/payslip` to select multiple employees or payroll periods for bulk actions (generate, print, email).
- This will require backend support for batch operations.

## Payslip Template Designer
- Create components and pages within `app/payslip` for a flexible payslip template designer feature.
- This will allow administrators to customize the layout, content fields, branding, and structure of the payslip PDF template through a user-friendly interface with preview functionality.
- Template data will need to be stored and retrieved.

## User Interface
- Design a user-friendly interface within `app/payslip` that allows easy navigation between the summary, individual payslip management, and template designer.
- Ensure the interface adheres to the existing project architecture and style, referencing components and libraries in `components/` and `lib/` as appropriate.
