3. [2025-04-14 00:52:00] Session-Based Sidebar Visibility Implementation
   - Purpose: Implement session-based sidebar visibility to restrict access to authenticated users only
   - Technical Choices:

     * Added ProtectedRoute component for securing routes

     * Session storage in localStorage with expiration
     * Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users to login page
   - User Experience:
